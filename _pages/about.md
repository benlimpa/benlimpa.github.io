I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA advised by [Miryung Kim](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/).

My interests include fuzz testing, software debugging, and machine learning. My current research goal is to improve the efficiency and efficacy of fuzz testing for compilers and similar subject programs that require structured inputs.
